The Last Class The Story of a Little Alsatian
I WAS very late for school that morning and I was terribly afraid of being scolded especially as
Monsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles and I did not know the first thing
about them For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields It was
such a warm lovely day I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood and in the
Rippert field behind the sawmill the Prussians going through their drill All that was much more
tempting to me than the rules concerning participles but I had the strength to resist and I ran as fast as I
could to school
As I passed the mayors office I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on which
notices were posted For two years all our bad news had come from that board battles lost
conscriptions orders from headquarters and I thought without stopping
What can it be now
Then as I ran across the square Wachter the blacksmith who stood there with his apprentice reading
the placard called out to me
Dont hurry so my boy youll get to your school soon enough
I thought that he was making fun of me and I ran into Monsieur Hamels little yard all out of breath
Usually at the beginning of school there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street desks
opening and closing lessons repeated aloud in unison with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker and
the teachers stout ruler beating on the desk
A little more quiet
I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed but as it happened that day everything was
quiet like a Sunday morning Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places and
Monsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm I had no open the door
and enter in the midst of that perfect silence You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I was
afraid
But no Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently
Go at once to your seat my little Frantz we were going to begin without you
I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk Not until then when I had partly recovered
from my fright did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat his plaited ruff and the black
silk embroidered breeches which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes
Moreover there was something extraordinary something solemn about the whole class But what
surprised me most was to see at the back of the room on the benches which were usually empty some
people from the village sitting as silent as we were old Hauser with his three-cornered hat the
ex-mayor the ex-postman and others besides They all seemed depressed and Hauser had brought an
old spelling-book with gnawed edges which he held wide-open on his knee with his great spectacles
askew
While I was wondering at all this Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform and in the same gentle
and serious voice with which he had welcomed me he said to us
My children this is the last time that I shall teach you Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothing
but German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine The new teacher arrives to-morrow This is the last
class in French so I beg you to be very attentive
Those few words overwhelmed me Ah the villains that was what they had posted at the mayors
office
My last class in French
And I barely knew how to write So I should never learn I must stop short where I was How angry I
was with myself because of the time I had wasted the lessons I had missed running about after nests or
sliding on the Saar My books which only a moment before I thought so tiresome so heavy to
carry my grammar my sacred history seemed to me now like old friends from whom I should be
terribly grieved to part And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel The thought that he was going
away that I should never see him again made me forget the punishments the blows with the ruler
Poor man It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes and I
understood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room It seemed to
mean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school It was also a way of thanking our teacher
for his forty years of faithful service and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing
I was at that point in my reflections when I heard my name called It was my turn to recite What would
I not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles in a loud
distinct voice without a slip But I got mixed up at the first words and I stood there swaying against my
bench with a full heart afraid to raise my head I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me
I will not scold you my little Frantz you must be punished enough that is the way it goes every day
we say to ourselves Pshaw I have time enough I will learn to-morrow And then you see what
happens Ah it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons until
to-morrow Now those people are entitled to say to us What you claim to be French and you can
neither speak nor write your language In all this my poor Frantz you are not the guiltiest one We all
have our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves
Your parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated They preferred to send you
to work in the fields or in the factories in order to have a few more sous And have I nothing to reproach
myself for Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying And when I wanted to go
fishing for trout have I ever hesitated to dismiss you
Then passing from one thing to another Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the French
language saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world the most clear the most
substantial that we must always retain it among ourselves and never forget it because when a people
falls into servitude so long as it clings to its language it is as if it held the key to its prison 1 Then he
took the grammer and read us our lesson I was amazed to see how readily I understood Everything that
he said seemed so easy to me so easy I believed too that I had never listened so closely and that he for
his part had never been so patient with his explanations One would have said that before going away
the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge to force it all into our heads at a single blow
When the lesson was at an end we passed to writing For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared some
entirely new examples on which was written in a fine round hand France Alsace France Alsace
They were like little flags waving all about the class hanging from the rods of our desks You should
have seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was Nothing could be heard save the grinding of the
pens over the paper At one time some cock-chafers flew in but no one paid any attention to them not
even the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines with a will and conscientious
application as if even the lines were French On the roof of the schoolhouse pigeons cooed in low tones
and I said to myself as I listened to them
I wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too
From time to time when I raised my eyes from my paper I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless in
his chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of his
little schoolhouse Think of it For forty years he had been there in the same place with his yard in front
of him and his class just as it was But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use the
walnuts in the yard had grown and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned the
windows even to the roof What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave all
those things and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead packing their trunks For
they were to go away the next day to leave the province forever
However he had the courage to keep the class to the end After the writing we had the lesson in
history then the little ones sang all together the ba be bi bo bu Yonder at the back of the room old
Hauser had put on his spectacles and holding his spelling-book in both hands he spelled out the letters
with them I could see that he too was applying himself His voice shook with emotion and it was so
funny to hear him that we all longed to laugh and to cry Ah I shall remember that last class
Suddenly the church clock struck twelve then the Angelus rang At the same moment the bugles of the
Prussians returning from drill blared under our windows Monsieur Hamel rose pale as death from his
chair Never had he seemed to me so tall
My friends he said my friends I I 
But something suffocated him He could not finish the sentence
Thereupon he turned to the blackboard took a piece of chalk and bearing on with all his might he
wrote in the largest letters he could
VIVE LA FRANCE
Then he stood there with his head resting against the wall and without speaking he motioned to us
with his hand
That is all go
